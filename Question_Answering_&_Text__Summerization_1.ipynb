        "> New Zealand (M캐ori: Aotearoa) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi), and a population of 4.9 million. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.\n",

        "Since 2017, transformer models have shown to outperform existing approaches for this task. Many pretrained transformer models exist, including BERT, GPT-2, XLNET. One of the newcomers to the group is ALBERT (A Lite BERT) which was published in September 2019. The research group claims that it outperforms BERT, with much less parameters (shorter training and inference time).\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial demonstrates how you can fine-tune ALBERT for the task of QnA and use it for inference. For this tutorial, we will use the transformer library built by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), which is an extremely nice implementation of the transformer models (including ALBERT) in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. You can  just use a fine-tuned model from their [model repository](https://huggingface.co/models) (which I encourage in general to save money and reduce emissions). However for educational purposes I will also show you how to finetune it yourself so you can adapt it for your own data.\n",
